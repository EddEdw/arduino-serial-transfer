# arduino-serial-wrap

This repository contains a small library to send INT, LONG, FLOAT and STRING via Arduino Serial. It also contains also a quick *.ino sketch to test sending and receiving.

## Usage

* Move the serialwrap.h file into the libraries folder (or import the *.zip file via Arduino IDE import).
* Upload the sketches to two separate Arduino boards.
* Use serial monitor to see if transfer acts as expected.
